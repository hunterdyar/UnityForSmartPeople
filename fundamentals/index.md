After we have a brief overview of the [Interface](the-unity-interface.md), the most important thing to understanding Unity, and how a unity project works, is to understand the core components to a project. I am calling these core components [building blocks.](unity-building-blocks.md)

## Unity Building Blocks

Read an overview here: [Unity Building Blocks](unity-building-blocks.md), then look through:

- [What Are Assets?](what-are-assets.md)
- [What Are GameObjects?](what-are-gameobjects.md)
- [What Are Unity Scenes?](what-are-unity-scenes.md)


## Common Components

There are some components you will find yourself using all of the time &#8211; like Cameras. After you feel like you understand the unity layout and it&#8217;s building blocks, but are still thinking &#8220;Sure, but how do we make _games_&#8220;, start looking through these overviews of common components.

- [The Transform Component](the-transform-component.md)
- [RigidBody Component](rigidbody-component.md)
- [Camera Component](camera-component.md)
