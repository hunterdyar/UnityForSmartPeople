The hierarchy window shows us a list of all of our GameObjects in a scene.

It also is where we can group [GameObjects](fundamentals/what-are-gameobjects/) together by dragging and dropping them. This is called &#8220;parenting&#8221;. It&#8217;s not just a visual organizational tool, it can have a major impact on how objects in the scene behave. 

See the official unity manual on the [hierarchy window.](https://docs.unity3d.com/Manual/Hierarchy.html)
