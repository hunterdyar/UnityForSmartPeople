The Scene View, or Scene Window, is where we will spend the majority of our time in Unity. It allows us to see our scene, and edit and select objects.

The scene View is most closely linked to the Hierarchy &#8211; they are both ways to edit a scene, and the Game View.

Read the page in the [Unity Manual](https://docs.unity3d.com/Manual/SceneViewNavigation.html) on the Scene View, the [Scene View Control Bar](https://docs.unity3d.com/Manual/ViewModes.html), and [Gizmos](https://docs.unity3d.com/Manual/GizmosMenu.html)<figure class="wp-block-embed-youtube wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio">
