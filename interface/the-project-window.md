The project window is the simplest of the main windows. It is a file navigator, like Finder on mac or Explorer on windows. It shows us our [assets](../fundamentals/what-are-assets/), and it allows us to select them for various purposes. Like adding an asset as a property on a [component](..//fundamentals/what-are-components/), creating a Prefab, or even quickly creating gameObjects.

The project window has a host of features that let us organize and search through our project. The quick search is a personal favorite. It supports filtering, and saving complex searches as &#8220;favorites&#8221; to quickly access again.

See all of the keyboard shortcuts that the project window supports on [this page](https://docs.unity3d.com/Manual/ProjectView.html) in the unity manual.

You can right click on the project window and select &#8220;Show In Explorer&#8221; or &#8220;Show In Finder&#8221;
