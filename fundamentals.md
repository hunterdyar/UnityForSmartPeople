After we have a brief overview of the [Interface,](http://54.198.102.119/the-unity-interface/) the most important thing to understanding Unity, and how a unity project works, is to understand the core components to a project. I am calling these core components [building blocks.](http://54.198.102.119/fundamentals/unity-building-blocks/)

## Unity Building Blocks

Read an overview here: [Unity Building Blocks](http://54.198.102.119/fundamentals/unity-building-blocks/), then look through:

<ul class="lcp_catlist" id="lcp_instance_0">

    <a href="http://unity.hdyar.com/fundamentals/what-are-assets/" title="What are Assets?">What are Assets?</a>
  </li>
  <li >
    <a href="http://unity.hdyar.com/fundamentals/what-are-gameobjects/" title="What Are GameObjects?">What Are GameObjects?</a>
  </li>
  <li >
    <a href="http://unity.hdyar.com/fundamentals/what-are-unity-scenes/" title="What Are Unity Scenes?">What Are Unity Scenes?</a>
  </li>
</ul>

## Common Components

There are some components you will find yourself using all of the time &#8211; like Cameras. After you feel like you understand the unity layout and it&#8217;s building blocks, but are still thinking &#8220;Sure, but how do we make _games_&#8220;, start looking through these overviews of common components.

<ul class="lcp_catlist" id="lcp_instance_0">
  <li >
    <a href="http://unity.hdyar.com/fundamentals/the-transform-component/" title="The Transform Component">The Transform Component</a>
  </li>
  <li >
    <a href="http://unity.hdyar.com/fundamentals/rigidbody-component/" title="RigidBody Component">RigidBody Component</a>
  </li>
  <li >
    <a href="http://unity.hdyar.com/fundamentals/camera-component/" title="Camera Component">Camera Component</a>
  </li>
</ul>
