A good way to start learning about scripting is to follow along with an example project. 

Start with the [unity roll-a-ball tutorial](https://unity3d.com/learn/tutorials/s/roll-ball-tutorial). I find unity&#8217;s [other official tutorials](https://unity3d.com/learn/tutorials) of this type not to be as helpful; there is a lot of scaffolding and such to ignore (where did these assets come from?) just to show basic concepts, but if you&#8217;re itching to get making something, check them out.

## What Are Scripts?

Scripts are just text files. They are [assets](../fundamentals/what-are-assets.md) in our project. We can think of scripts as components. When we write a script, we are making our own components, adding our own behavior and functionality.

We almost always need to write our own scripts in order to create games &#8211; you can&#8217;t get by without them, but we don't often need all that much complexity, and frequently can avoid doing advanced things.

## C# vs. JavaScript vs. UnityScript

Q: Which should you use?  
A: C#.

Do you already know javascript? **use c#Â anyway.** Because I said so.

Unity doesn&#8217;t support [UnityScript](https://blogs.unity3d.com/2017/08/11/unityscripts-long-ride-off-into-the-sunset/) anymore, and if you see that term it means you are looking at something out of date. Ignore it completely.
