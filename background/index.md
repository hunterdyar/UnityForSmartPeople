There are a lot of things that you don't really *need* to know in order to start using Unity, but are extremely helpful. I've brought a lot of this "prereq" or "background" knoweldge here. 

There isn't an order here, these pages were compiled from questions I have answered students while learning Unity. Various moments of "Aha, the real problem is confusion about xyz".
